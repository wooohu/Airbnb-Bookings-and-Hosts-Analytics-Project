This project uses Airbnb data from Kaggle, which can be downloaded here:
https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston/data

The purpose of this analysis is to understand what makes a listing popular, find trends in Airbnb user behavior, and identify gaps in what listings offer versus what Airbnb customers are looking for.

The data includes listings and reviews and covers the Boston area.  
The 'Listings' dataset includes information about each property and corresponding host, such as number of bedrooms, weekly/monthly price, instant bookable, and whether the host is a superhost.
The 'Reviews' dataset includes the reviews text, listing ID, reviewer ID, and date.
